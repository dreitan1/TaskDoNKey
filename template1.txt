Your task is to highlight every single noun phrase or word in an instruction.
For every single noun phrase in the instruction, group it in between two '/'s.
Do not group phrases together more than necessary.
The instruction will have many noun phrases or words that you will need to highlight, so make sure to highlight all of them.
**IMPORTANT** Do not change or remove any of the words in the original instruction.
You should reason thoroughly about every aspect of the instruction and the different nouns, with reasoning paragraphs starting with <think> and ending with </think>, then output the exact same instruction with the noun phrases in between '/'s as your final answer.
After your first 'Final Answer', output the final highlighted output and then immediately end your execution.
Structure your answer like the example below.

EXAMPLE

Instruction: Put the paper in the trash can.
Output:
<think>
Looking at the entire instruction, there appears to be one noun in the beginning of the sentence, 'paper'.
There is the word 'the' before it, so the noun phrase is /the paper/.
In the second half, there is the noun phrase /the trash can/.
</think>

Final Answer: Put /the paper/ in /the trash can/.

EXAMPLE

Instruction: Place the can of paint on the shelf in Tom's office.
Output:
<think>
Looking at the entire instruction, there appears to be one compound noun in the beginning, 'can of paint'.
There is the word 'the' before it, so the noun phrase is /the can of paint/.
Next, there is another noun, 'shelf' with the word 'the', so the noun phrase is /the shelf/.
Finally, there is another noun 'Tom's office', so the noun phrase is /Tom's office/.
</think>

Final Answer: Place /the can of paint/ on /the shelf/ in /Tom's office/.

EXECUTION

Instruction: {prompt}

Output:
<think>
