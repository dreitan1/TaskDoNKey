Your task is to provide possible disambiguations for the phrase below.
The phrase is part of a broader instruction, so think about the entire instruction, the speaker, and the world state when reasoning.
Given the world state below, provide all of the possible options that you think could be likely.
After reasoning, provide your Final Answer in a newline-seperated list, containing the exact item descriptors from the world state.
**IMPORTANT** Make sure not to change the object descriptors from those in the world state. Use exactly the same ones.
**IMPORTANT** Only choose items from the current world state, and not from EXAMPLE world states. **Never** use any information from the EXAMPLEs.
Format your response similar to the EXAMPLEs, but use reasoning specific to the instruction and world state in the EXECUTION.
The EXAMPLEs exist **only** to provide formatting structure. Your EXECUTION should be completely distinct from them.
There should only be **one** EXECUTION. End your response after the Final Answer in the EXECUTION.

EXAMPLE

World State:
(Computer, on_desk)
(Laptop, in_lobby)
(Computer mouse, in_drawer)
(Tom's office, office_3)

Instruction:
Evan: Plug the mouse into the computer.

Phrase to Disambiguate:
the computer

Output:
<think>
Alright, so I need to disambiguate the phrase "the computer" for the instruction "Plug the mouse into the computer".
Let me look at the world state to see what I can find that would fit "the computer".
"Computer" could be a match.
A laptop is a kind of computer, so "Laptop" could match.
Therefore, I should output the object descriptors for Computer and Laptop, so I will look at the current world state to find those.
The object descriptor for Computer is (Computer, on_desk), so I will make sure not to change that.
The object descriptor for Scrap paper is (Laptop, in_lobby), so I will make sure not to change that.
</think>

Final Answer:
1. (Computer, on_desk)
2. (Laptop, in_lobby)


EXAMPLE

World State:
(Meeting notes, in_Conference_Room)
(Scrap paper, in_Conference_Room)
(Ream, in_printer)
(Trash can, in_Lobby)
(Soda can, on_table)
(Lobby, room_1)
(Conference Room, room_2)

Instruction:
Rose: Put the paper in the trash can.

Phrase to Disambiguate:
the paper

Output:
<think>
Alright, so I need to disambiguate the phrase "the paper" for the instruction "Put the paper in the trash can".
Let me look at the world state to see what I can find that would fit "the paper".
Notes are a kind of paper, so "Meeting notes" could be it.
Scrap paper is a kind of paper, so it could be "Scrap paper".
"Ream" refers to a ream of paper, so it could also be a match.
Therefore, I should output the object descriptors for Meeting notes, Ream of paper, and Scrap paper, so I will look at the current world state to find those.
The object descriptor for Meeting notes is (Meeting notes, in_Conference_Room), so I will make sure not to change that.
The object descriptor for Scrap paper is (Scrap paper, in_Conference_Room), so I will make sure not to change that.
The object descriptor for Ream of paper is (Ream of paper, in_printer), so I will make sure not to change that.

Final Answer:
1. (Meeting notes, in_Conference_Room)
2. (Scrap paper, in_Conference_Room)
3. (Ream, in_printer)
