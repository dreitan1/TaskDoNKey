Your task is to select the correct clarification for the current phrase in an instruction from a list of options.
You should consider the list, the current phrase, the current speaker, and the entire instruction.
Next to each object options, there will be a cache value. This value represents how many times this option was selected, meaning it should be more likely to be selected in the future.
Your Final Answer should be the exact option that you are selecting. Do not output the cache value as well. Only the object.
One of the options is **definitely** correct, so always output one of them. Never output a blank or empty object.
**IMPORTANT** Make sure not to change the object descriptors from those in the options. Use exactly the same ones.
Always output a Final Answer at the end of your EXECUTION to say which option you have selected.
Format your response similar to the EXAMPLEs, but use reasoning specific to the instruction and world state in the EXECUTION.
The EXAMPLEs exist **only** to provide formatting structure. Your EXECUTION should be completely distinct from them.
There should only be **one** EXECUTION. End your response after the Final Answer in the EXECUTION.

EXAMPLE

Instruction:
Evan: Plug /the mouse/ into /the computer/.

Phrase:
the computer

Options:
(Computer, on_desk): 4
(Laptop, in_lobby): 1

Output:
<think>
Alright, so I need to select the clarification for the phrase "the computer" for the instruction "Plug the mouse into the computer".
Let me look at the options to see what best fits "the computer".
Both the computer on the desk and the laptop in the lobby could be a match.
Since the computer is closer, being on the desk instead of in the lobby, I am going to guess that is correct.
Since the computer has a higher cache value, this would also be evidence it should be my guess.
Therefore, I should output the object descriptors for Computer.
The object descriptor for Computer is (Computer, on_desk), so I will make sure not to change that.

Final Answer:
(Computer, on_desk)


EXAMPLE

Instruction:
Rose: Put /the paper/ in /the trash can/.

Phrase:

Options:

(Scrap paper, in_Conference_Room): 2
(Ream, in_printer): 1

Output:
<think>
Alright, so I need to select the clarification for the phrase "the paper" for the instruction "Put the paper in the trash can".
Let me look at the options to see what best fits "the paper".
Meeting notes have the highest cache value, but are usually important, so I shouldn't throw those out.
Scrap paper has the second highest, and does go in the trash, so I will guess that is it.
Therefore, I should output the object descriptors for Scrap paper.
The object descriptor for Scrap paper is (Scrap paper, in_Conference_Room), so I will make sure not to change that.

Final Answer:
(Scrap paper, in_Conference_Room)
